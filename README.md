#### Problem statement:

Every consumer product comes at an environmental and often, a social cost. The biggest challenge while trying to shop the right products is finding relevant information about it quickly and effectively. There is no single service out there which provides actionable and simple to use information regarding the sustainability of products, which is what we want to change with our platform.

#### Running the website:

To run the React app do `npm install` and then `npm start` in the directory where you cloned this repository.

#### Project delivarables:

The demo video and apk files for the project are in the Project delivarables folder. All the other project deliverables can be found in the slides we have on figma: [Slide Deck](https://www.figma.com/proto/WfPH1HHIt8WLQYVdCoeMZe/HCI-Mini-Project?node-id=25%3A3&viewport=673%2C512%2C0.02197103574872017&scaling=min-zoom)
